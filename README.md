# Benoit's NOT-projecteuler.net

[Project Euler.net](https://projecteuler.net/) contains amazing mathematical puzzles.
The majority of them require programming a computer to find the solution.

The project discourages users from publishing their solutions, as users should be encouraged
to determine the solution on their own, to experience the joy of the "Aha!" moment that comes
with discovery. I fully agree with that and if you attempt these problems,
NEVER search for other's solution until you have solved them yourself.

In that spirit... What you will find here are definitely not solutions to Project Euler problems.
Nope, look elsewhere ;-) Like, for example, fellow Canadian
