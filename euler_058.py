# (Euler 058)
# Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side 
# length 7 is formed.
#
# 37 36 35 34 33 32 31
# 38 17 16 15 14 13 30
# 39 18  5  4  3 12 29
# 40 19  6  1  2 11 28
# 41 20  7  8  9 10 27
# 42 21 22 23 24 25 26
# 43 44 45 46 47 48 49
#
# It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what 
# is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; 
# that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
#
# If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with 
# side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, 
# what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both 
# diagonals first falls below 10%?

# euler_028 is a similar problem. In it, I noted
# the two diagonals contain the numbers:
# top-left-to-bottom-right diagonal: (A) 1-3-7-13-21-31-43-57-73-...
# bottom-left-to-top-right diagonal: (B) 1-5-9-17-25-37-49-65-81-...
# 
# The increments between the terms in series (A) are, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... or 2n
# (B) is a little more tricky. The increment between the terms is 4,4,8,8,12,12,16,16,...
# Repeats twice, then jumps by 4... So (n//2)*4
